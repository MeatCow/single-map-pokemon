# Single map pokemon game

Welcome! This is a project that I created back in college using winforms in C#.
It is essentially a pokemon like that allows you to walk around listening to sick tunes, fight monsters, and chat with npcs.

## Setup

Simply download the sources and build a debug version using Visual Studio(2015, 2019, etc.) to get up and running.

## Gameplay

Move around using the arrow keys, and modify the music using the 1 - 4 buttons. Use the mouse for control during combat.

Visit the shrine hidden by the maze in the bottom right corner for a musical surprise...

### TODO

Translate from french to english.
